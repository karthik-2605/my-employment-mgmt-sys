## Employee Management System  

# A simple Employee management system built by using HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, Express and MySQL 

## Features
- Add, update, delete, and search employee records.
- Secure database storage with MySQL.
- RESTful API with Express.js.
- Environment variables (`.env`) for security.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
- **Frontend & Backend Integration** – Sending and receiving data between client and server using `fetch()`.
- **Node.js & Express** – Building a REST API for CRUD operations.
- **MySQL Database Management** – Connecting, querying, and securing a database.
- **Environment Variables** – Hiding sensitive data with `.env` files.
- **Git & GitHub** – Initializing a repository, adding a `.gitignore`, and pushing securely.
